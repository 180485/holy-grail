            Oxtail soup is comfort food to feed your soul. This is Indonesian version, served with vegetables and rich but clear beef broth.
            Oxtail soup is one of popular dish in Asian, one of them is Indonesia. We called it “sop buntut” in Indonesia. It is made with oxtail (beef tails), served with vegetables and beef broth. In Indonesian version the oxtail is boiled or pressure cooked until tender and then served with the broth and vegetables. The other ingredients are potatoes, carrots, celery, green onion, and fried shallots.
