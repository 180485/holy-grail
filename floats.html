        <P>Beef Rendang is a Indonesian curry and is considered by many to be the king of all curries! To say itâ€™s extravagantly delicious is an understatement. There are very few curries in this world with such amazingly complex flavours.

            Originally from Indonesia though now more well known as a Malaysia curry, the sauce is made with aromatic spices like cinnamon, cardamom and star anise as well as fresh aromatics including lemongrass, garlic, ginger and galangal.

            Unlike many curries, Beef Rendang is a dry curry which means there is not loads of sauce. However, the meat is so ridiculously tender and has a thick coating of sauce on each piece, so when the meat literally falls apart at a touch, it mixes through rice, flavouring it like saucy curries.

            If you love South East Asian curries, Beef Rendang is without a doubt one of the best!</P>
